                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Filters tradeoff accuracy for space and occasionally return false positive matches with a bounded error. Numerous systems use filters
                in fast memory to avoid performing expensive I/Os to slow storage. A fundamental limitation in traditional filters is that they do
                not change their representation upon seeing a false positive match. Therefore, the maximum false positive rate is only guaranteed for
                a single and not an arbitrary set of queries. We can improve the
                filterâ€™s performance on a stream of queries (especially on skewed
                distributions) if we can adapt after seeing false positives.</p>
                <p>Adaptive filters, such as telescoping and adaptive cuckoo filters,
                update their representation upon detecting a false positive to avoid
                repeating the same error in the future. Adaptive filters require an
                auxiliary structure, typically much larger than the main filter and
                often residing on slow storage, to facilitate adaptation.</p>
                <p>However, existing adaptive filters are not practical and have seen
                no adoption in real-world systems due to two main reasons. Firstly,
                they offer weak adaptivity guarantees, meaning that fixing a new
                false positive can cause a previously fixed false positive to come back.
                Secondly, the sub-optimal design of the auxiliary structure results in
                adaptivity overheads so substantial that they can actually diminish
                the overall system performance compared to a traditional filter.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we design and implement AdaptiveQF, the first
                practical adaptive filter with minimal adaptivity overhead and strong
                adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and falsepositive guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads.</p>
                <p>The AdaptiveQF is based on the state-of-the-art quotient filter design and preserves all the critical features of the quotient filter such
                as cache efficiency and mergeability. Furthermore, we employ a new
                auxiliary structure design which results in considerably low adaptivity overhead and makes the AdaptiveQF practical in real systems.</p>
