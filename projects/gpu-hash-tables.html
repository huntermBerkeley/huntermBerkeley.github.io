                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>GPU hash tables are increasingly used to
accelerate data processing, but their limited functionality
restricts adoption in large-scale data processing applications.
Current limitations include incomplete concurrency support
and missing compound operations such as upserts.</p>
                <p>This paper presents WarpSpeed, a library of highperformance concurrent GPU hash tables with a unified
benchmarking framework for performance analysis.
WarpSpeed implements eight state-of-the-art Nvidia GPU
hash table designs and provides a rich API designed for
modern GPU applications. Our evaluation uses diverse
benchmarks to assess both correctness and scalability, and
we demonstrate real-world impact by integrating these
hash tables into three downstream applications.</p>
                <p>We propose several optimization techniques to
reduce concurrency overhead, including fingerprint-based
metadata to minimize cache line probes and specialized
Nvidia GPU instructions for lock-free queries. Our findings
provide new insights into concurrent GPU hash table
design and offer practical guidance for developing efficient,
scalable data structures on modern GPUs.</p>
