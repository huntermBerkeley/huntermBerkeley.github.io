                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Traditional filter data structures, such as Bloom filters, do not offer necessary features that modern high-performance data analytics applications need in order to efficiently perform complex data analysis tasks. For example, MetaHipMer, a de novo metagenome assembler, can use filters to weed out singleton k-mers and reduce memory usage by 30%-70%. However, the filter needs the ability to associate values with k-mers in order to perform the analysis in a single communication pass. Bloom filters do not support value associations and cause the application to perform an extra communication pass, thereby increasing the run time. Therefore, MetaHipMer faces a trade off between memory and speed due to the limited capabilities of traditional filters. In this paper, we overcome the memory and speed trade off in MetaHipMer by integrating a GPU-based feature-rich filter, the Two-Choice filter (TCF), in the MetaHipMer pipeline. The TCF uses key-value association to approximately store k-mers with extensions. This allows MetaHipMer to perform k-mer analysis on the GPUs in a single communication pass. Our empirical analysis shows a 50% reduction in memory usage in k-mer analysis on each node in MetaHipMer without any effect on the overall run time or assembly quality. The memory reduction in turn results in a 43% reduction in the number of nodes required to assemble datasets and enables MetaHipMer to scale to much larger datasets.</p>
